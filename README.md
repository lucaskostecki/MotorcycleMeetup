This repository is for the Motorcycle Meetup web application for Enterprise Java

##Problem Statement
During the riding months it's nice to sometimes share an afternoon riding with other company. The problem that I often
encounter is I don't have anyone else to ride with. From time to time, I'd like to ride my motorcycle with another person
or a small group but because of the limited number of people that I know that also ride, I often find myself riding by alone.

The goal of Motorcycle Meetup *(MM)* is to allow other riders to find other people to ride with. MM will allow the user
to plan routes using Google Maps, invite users to join them on their route using a permalink that they can send, make a
public meetup which could be useful for businesses that want to host weekly shows, and offer logging services for keeping
track of your rides by logging them after you return.
